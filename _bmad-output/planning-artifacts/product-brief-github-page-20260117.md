# Product Brief: github-page

## 1. Project Overview & Discovery
**Status:** Completed
**Key Insights:** The project aims to build a high-performance, multi-lingual portfolio site on GitHub Pages. It will leverage Contentful for content management and Python for data transformation, based on the `al-folio` Jekyll theme.

## 2. Brainstorming Outcomes (2026-01-18)
**Session Summary:** A structured session focused on integrating Contentful, Python, and ISO-compliant localization into the `al-folio` base.

### Key Strategic Pillars:
1. **Contentful-Python Bridge:** Using Python to sync headless CMS data into static Jekyll collections.
2. **ISO-Standard Localization:** Implementing URL routing and content fields using ISO 639-1 codes.
3. **Unified UX Control:** A top-right toggle for seamless theme and language switching.

**Top Priority:** Developing the Python transformation layer to handle the Contentful-to-Jekyll pipeline.
